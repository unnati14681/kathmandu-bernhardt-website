            <h3>Tasty and healthy food</h3>
            <p>The necessity of a college canteen (cafeteria) is to serve food and drink to the students, teachers and other employees. Its importance is really great. We are lucky that we have a very good canteen in our college which is housed in a separate building.
                We can get refreshments here. The canteen opens daily with the beginning of the normal works of the college and closes in the evening.
                In a canteen, there are chairs and tables. A college canteen is indeed very useful for students.</p>
