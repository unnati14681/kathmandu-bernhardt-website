            <h3>Sports</h3>
            <p>Games and sports are as essential as studies. They provide the much desired change in the dull academic life of the college.
                Being involved in sports teaches you various interpersonal skills such as patience, communication, leadership, punctuality, accountability, teamwork, trust, and others which will help you not only to win a particular sports competition but also grow and achieve success in life.

            <h3>Tasty and healthy food</h3>
            <p>The necessity of a college canteen (cafeteria) is to serve food and drink to the students, teachers and other employees. Its importance is really great. We are lucky that we have a very good canteen in our college which is housed in a separate building.
                We can get refreshments here. The canteen opens daily with the beginning of the normal works of the college and closes in the evening.
                In a canteen, there are chairs and tables. A college canteen is indeed very useful for students.</p>
